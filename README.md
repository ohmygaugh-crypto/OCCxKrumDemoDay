Just a obsidian plugin that exports a canvas to html along with the selected directorys and files that are called to render within the canvas viewport

https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart#creating-your-website

NOTE: it may take up to 10 minutes for the changes to take effect

so be patient ;)

be sure to have the html file names index and not the title of the file originating from the obsidian vault
as only index.html will be recognized by internet service provdiers
